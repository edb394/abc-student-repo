This was a pretty tough project! I had to look up detailed walkthroughs of how to get the timer to work. I had issues with when I was defining the variables and needing to monitor how much time had passed, was remaining, and on the timer to start with. I also wasn't able to solve the mystery of showing milliseconds in the time remaining, which I wanted to include in order to make the game feel more high-stakes. Because I couldn't do this with a JS `setInterval` (running a function 1000x/second would not go over well), I made the time decrease twice as fast as it actually does so the game still seems somewhat urgent.

Another roadblock I encountered was making clicking blue windows result in an instant game over. The most relevant method I could find online was using `window.opener`, but this seemed to only be able to edit values, not call functions, so I had to edit a `p` element on the DOM with a CSS value of `display:none`.

The last difficulty was monitoring wins from deleting all of the red windows. Finding when `window.closed` would be true seemed really unintuitive to me, so I ended up using a `setTimeout` with the time equal to the time remaining on the timer, thus calling a `window.closed` check for every single red window that was generated. This then caused issues with multiple `true`s and `false`s (if not every window was open or closed) and so I had to create another variable that would override a win if *any* `window.closed` values were `false`.
