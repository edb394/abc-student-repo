#Armie the Armchair Activist
This is a project created to cast a satirical light on the use of Twitter in a political/activist sentiment. On the one hand, while Twitter can be a good, accessible medium to share news and information, a lot of the time it gets filled with people sharing their opinions and clouding what would otherwise be a beneficial learning source. Sharing opinions is fine, of course, but this project shows just how pointless it can be sometimes.

The way this is achieved is by generating a repetitive set of tweets supposedly written by Armie, the person depicted in the armchair (not doing anything in real live to be an activist). The repetition is supposed to indicate how it can just end up being an echo chamber of hearing the same thoughts.

However, the project ended being a lot more narrow and repetitive than I had wished. Thankfully, this helps reinforce the point, but I thought my execution would be able to be somewhat richer than it was. Including real-time Tweets from Donald Trump and ensuring these worked correctly made me have to remove other features, sadly, but also ensures that each visit to the site is unique, which is something I was sure I wanted to hav in the project; I believe it makes it more life-like.

I enjoyed being able to explore generating elements and using APIs in this project. If I had more ability, I would make the elements more richly generated as well as randomizing the content more in order to convey the purpose more aptly.
