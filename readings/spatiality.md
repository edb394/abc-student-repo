All of these artists’ works are very personal, and show a deep meditation on how they exist in not only the physical world, but also in the virtual world. The way that these are tied together makes a unique position on the nature of these worlds themselves (and their “spatiality”).

I think the works by Eva and Franco Mattes is especially poignant in this regard. This is because, for example, of Life Sharing artificially tying their lives to the internet before any of the general public realized this would be part of the internet. And they did it on their own terms, rather than the corporate/government tracking that we experience now. It offers a kind of parallel comparison of what the internet was imagined to be next to what it is today. It also helps us realize the grand amount of data that is able to be (and is) collected about us largely without our knowledge. It makes the space that users take up in the internet feel a lot more real than usual.
