I think the way Lialina classifies web design
into "professional" and" vernacular" is something
I had never explicitly pondered before, but
I couldn't think of a more fitting way
to describe it.

Especially in the second installment, the way she describes the transition from homepages to Myspace pages is particularly clairvoyant. The parts of personal webpage design that she began
to see artifact, disappear, or metamorph
with this transition continued to happen
again and again in the years to come
with transitions to Facebook, Tumblr, Twitter,
and Instagram.

With all these transitions, however, I think
Lialina would argue that the
vernacular web began to lose its
independence. The individual user lost more
and more power to exist outside of the
bounds the professional web developer set
for them in these rich
online apps. And then, once the
average user did not generally have any
knowledge of how the web works
(and the user base expanded greatly) the
corporations that make money off the
users' clicks also started to make
pages as the sites, pretending to be a
part of the vernacular too.

But even now, there are still the
same "fads" that come and go like
Lialina documented in her essays--
the participatory spirit of the vernacular
is still there. And while the
new generations are not aware of
much of the history of the web
(I don't think I've used a MIDI file
a single time, ever) things like animated
GIFs, still have a long time ahead
of them.
