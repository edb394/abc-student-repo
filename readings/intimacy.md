As with many parts of our rapidly evolving and ever-changing digital lives, the way relationships manifest also changes frequently. McHugh presented some full-fledged dives into online relationships where the partakers have completely new personas; this is definitely one way that people interact online. Especially in the early days of the internet, the temptation to idealize oneself was all too easy to succumb to. However, as he also mentioned with the rise of “digital natives” on Web 2.0, people generally view their online selves as parallels of their real selves. That is, creating a new persona just to act as online is not really of any use—and also as mentioned by McHugh, a fake online relationship could never transition to a real life one; there would not be the same kind of sensation or chemistry between the couple.


So, as a “digital native” myself, I have also experienced an online life where most interaction is seen as parallel to interaction in reality. If you meet someone online, you want to meet them in real life, and you build trust by sharing real details to build a closer picture to the real you, almost as if you are slowly building a bridge to that real life meet-up.
